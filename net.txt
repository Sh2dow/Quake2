when it is possible, that 2 sockets (server+client) used at the same time? (server browser?)
which port used for network connection? (server port?)
BUG: when server launched, cannot see other servers in "join" menu - cl send "info" req, remote
 server answer "info ...", and this answer go to out local server, where rejected (should go to client!)
 - original Q2 uses PORT_SERVER and PORT_CLIENT - 2 sockets
 - may be, create temp connection with separate port (when to close connection, if no answers?)
=================
loopback: can use single buffer, if ensure no NET_SendPacket() while data not completely
  read using NET_GetPacket() in both client and server ReadPackets() functions (i.e.
  ReadPackets() function should be complete before 1st attempt to send data over network - this
  attempt is only OutOfBandPrint() ? - other data collected in netchan_t and sent on frame end
may be, use NET_SetSock(server|client) (which name?) -- will select used loopback buffer
  (BUT: readBuf != writeBuf) - and eliminate "sock" parameter from all data ...
problem: "qport" field in packets when sending message from client to server - needs to know,
  is it server or client (may keep this field in netchan_t, and remove from other funcs);
  NS_CLIENT, NS_SERVER here -> "netchan::bool isServer"
DEDICATED_ONLY: no loopback + no NET_Config() - always multiplayer
loopback code: move to netchan.cpp
